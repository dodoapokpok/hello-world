Fika isn't an actual swedish thing. STOP USING IT!
Tell me. Have you ever gone to a coffee shop with a friend, a loved one or an aqcuaintance? Maybe you had a pastry with your coffee/tea but not necessarily. Guess what? THAT WAS FIKA! Holy hell don't you feel so freaking Swedish now?! What a unique cultural experience! Stop it please! Fika just means to go have coffee with someone. IT'S NOT SWEDISH!!!
